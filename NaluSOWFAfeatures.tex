\title{SOWFA/OpenFOAM and Nalu Current Features}
\maketitle

This document is intended to outline the features of SOWFA/OpenFOAM and Nalu that are pertinent to wind energy.  They are meant to guide the development 
of Nalu for wind energy applications.  Both OpenFOAM and Nalu have many features beyond those listed here.
